# MBNPy toolkit

## Description
MBNPy is a Bayesian Network toolkit designed to handle a large number of parent nodesâ€”problems where conventional BN tools often fall short.  
Example applications include [transport networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2019.01.007) and [pipeline networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.107468).
