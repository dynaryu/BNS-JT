<h1>MBNPy</h1>

<h3>A Python toolkit for white-box risk assessment of complex, large-scale systems</h3>
<p class="message">As <b>a companion toolkit of <em>matrix-based Bayesian network</em> (MBN)</b>, MBNPy is a tool for <b>risk assessment of <em>large-scale,</em> discrete-state system events.</b><sup><b>1</b></sup> MBNPy boldly pursues an innovative pathway to deliver <b>power-saving, fast, and detailed risk solutions.</b></p>
<p>With large-scale systems, the challenge arises from their giant probability distributions conditioned on numerous components.</p>
<p class="message">MBNPy provides <b>quantification algorithms that encode those giant probability distributions</b> and <b>inference functions that handle encoded distributions.</b></p>

<p>This is in contrast to recent trends in leveraging High Performance Computing (HPC) power such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) using HPC or training Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to replace an expensive system performance function (i.e. system simulator).</p>
  
<p class="message"> Of course there is no free lunch and MBNPy is no exception. Unlike MCS being applicable to any general systems, MBNPy requires system-specific quantification algorithms. <b>Good news, many system events have already been explored</b> and more research is underway. Check out what system types are available here!</p>
  

<div class="footnote">
<b>1.</b> For continuous-state events, advanced simulation methods (e.g. subset simulation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) have been successfully developed.
